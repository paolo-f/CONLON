L. Angioloni, T. Borghuis, L. Brusci, and P. Frasconi. CONLON: A Pseudo-Song Generator Based on a New Pianoroll, Wasserstein Autoencoders, and Optimal Interpolations. *In  Proceedings of the 21st International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference*, ISMIR 2020.


CONLON is a pattern-based MIDI music generator with three main features:
- A novel pianoroll-like description of patterns
- Wasserstein eutoencoders as the underlying generative model
- Optimal trajectories for interpolation and swirls.

CONLON was developed as a collaborative effort between the [AI Lab](http://ai.dinfo.unifi.it) at [DINFO](http://dinfo.unifi.it), [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it), (Italy) and [MUSI-CO](https://www.musi-co.com/), a music generation startup based in Eindhoven (the Netherlands).

## Source code
We are sorry that source code cannot be provided at this time (please do not ask, if code can be made available it will appear here). The [WAE implementation of Ilya Tolstikhin](https://github.com/tolstikhin/wae) is a good starting point for developing the generative model.
