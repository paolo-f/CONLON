This folder contains four samples for dataset ASF-4:

- Two interpolations from two specific start-goal test set patterns obtained from Wasserstein autoencoders:

  - [Patterns described by our CONLON PianoRolls](./WAE_PRC_interpolation_from_Acid_Sunrise_Jam_25_to_Soul_Diamond_Main_4.mp3)
  - [Patterns described by PianoRolls as in (Dong et al. 2018)](./WAE_PR_interpolation_from_Acid_Sunrise_Jam_25_to_Soul_Diamond_Main_4.mp3)

- Two swirls obtained from Wasserstein autoencoders:

  - [Patterns described by our CONLON PianoRolls](./WAE_PRC_Swirl.mp3)
  - [Patterns described by PianoRolls as in (Dong et al. 2018)](./WAE_PR_Swirl.mp3)

For all models we set the interpolation and swirl length equal to 64 patterns, the desired length equal to 16 patterns, and the widest-path horizon equal to 20 patterns.
